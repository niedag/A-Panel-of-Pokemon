# A Panel of Pokemon
A Panel of Pokemon is a game created using Java on Eclipse Oxygen in 2019 for a final project in AP Computer Science.
The game operates on a single Java panel. The layout of the map is entirely procedurally generated with grass and tree barriers in the center. Heal your Pokemon at the Pokemon Center and defeat the Pokemon Gym boss!

After downloading the project file, the game can be run by running the PokemonGameMain.java file in the mainGame package folder. Enjoy!

Controls:
WASD for movement
Mouse Click for choosing battle options

Runs on default Java library. Still figuring out how to create an executable java application to distribute the game...
Can run currently using latest versions of Java (5/28/2024)

Next project: 
Build a new game from scratch with Java or with Unity
- Multiplayer game, able to host the game locally, send an executable to another person to play it!
