# A Panel of Pokemon
A Panel of Pokemon is a game created using Java on Eclipse Oxygen in 2019 for a final project in AP Computer Science.

Demonstration of applying OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism.
Examples of method overriding and method overloading

After opening the game up in Eclipse, the game can be run by running the PokemonGameMain.java file in the mainGame package folder.

Runs on default Java library. Still figuring out how to create an executable java application to distribute the game...
Can run currently using latest versions of Java (5/28/2024)

Next project: 
Build a new game from scratch with Java or with Unity
- Multiplayer game, able to host the game locally, send an executable to another person to play it!
